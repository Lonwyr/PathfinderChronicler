appDescription=Pathfinder Chronicle Sheet Filling Tool

welcome=Welcome to the Pathfinder Chronicler.\nHere you can prefill chronicle sheets by using your events, players and their characters (and have them remembered).\n\nNavigate, load and save with the action bar at the bottom.
providePdf=Since Paizo Inc. has the chronicle sheet as part of the scenarios, it is well protected against us, just grabbing them.\nTo still use them for auto-filling please open the scenario, print the chronicle sheet page in 'Actual Size' to an pdf (i.e. 'Microsoft Print to PDF').
noDataStored=Absolutely no data will leave your device.\nThe drawback: you must load & save the events and players on your device.
